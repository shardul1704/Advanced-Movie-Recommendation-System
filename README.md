# Advanced-Movie-Recommendation-System

We had two approaches for a Movie Recommendation System:
1. Content Based Recommendation
2. State-of-art Nvidia Merlin Recommendation Models

Built a content based movie recommendation system using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. The system will recommend movies that are similar to a given movie based on its genres, keywords, cast, crew and overview. Our implementation is present in the Content Based Movie System directory. We have also deployed the project with a web app to Heroku - https://content-based-movie-recommend-6104417e7e90.herokuapp.com/

Built and trained a recommender system using NVIDIA's Merlin models on the MovieLens 25 million dataset. The python notebook for the same is present in the Nvidia Merlin Implementation directory. The notebook is heavily inspired from Nvidia's official implementation present on their github - https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin
